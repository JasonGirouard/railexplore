            Train Gang exists to help you travel by train. At best, it hopes to
            inspire you to visit local destinations you otherwise wouldn't.

            Passenger rail provides a peace of mind, free from traffic and
            dangerous drivers, that traveling by car simply can't deliver. Why
            not travel by train?

              Amtrak and other passenger rail websites are effective when you
              already know your origin & destination â€” but they aren't effective
              when you don't.

            <p>
              Rather than staring at transit maps and manually checking
              different travel times & prices, why not explore all your
              possibilities at once?
